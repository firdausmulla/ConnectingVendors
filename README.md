# Vendor’s Place – Web-Based Vendor Discovery Platform

## Overview
Vendor’s Place is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between local vendors (hawkers, small shops) and buyers by providing real-time information about vendor availability, products and locations.  
The platform helps users easily find nearby vendors and enables vendors to gain online visibility.

This project was developed as part of **T.Y.B.Sc. Computer Science (Semester VI)** under **HSNC University, Mumbai**.
